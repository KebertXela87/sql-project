step 1 of the project<br>
<p>a.<br>Talk to me about your project idea. Just give me a two minute summary of what you want to do. I just want to get a sense of whether what you are proposing lends itself to complex database queries.</p>
<p>b.<br>Once that is done, you need to meet as a team as discussed in the related video. At the completion of this meeting you should send an email to submit.o.bot@gmail.com with the following information</p>
<ul>

<li>a short 1-2 sentence description of the project</li>
<li>the members of the team, </li>
<li>the name of the Scrum master, </li>
<li>the link to the github repository </li>
<li>the link to the trello project page (make sure that page is public).</li>
</ul>
